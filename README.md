# Programming-Fundamentals
Noughts and Crosses developed in Python to be played against either another person or the computer.

## Overview
*It is recommended to run this file using Python's IDLE.*
The game 'Noughts and Crosses' has been developed in Python 3.9 to allow the user to play on their own against the computer or another person. Players are able to choose between playing the 'X' piece or 'O' piece (**not** case-sensitive) before the game starts and while the game is being played! This task was set as an assignment for my university's Computer Science course.
